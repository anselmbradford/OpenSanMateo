# This file is included into .htaccess at the appropriate section
# in Drupal's .htaccess file (right after the RewriteEngine on
# directive. It must be included there because the file not found
# handling here must take action before the normal file not found
# handling otherwise Drupal will try to take over the 404 handling
# for static sites
#
# To add a new static site, create a sites directory just like
# you were creating a normal Drupal site and then add lines below
# for the domain to transform it to look in the site's files/html
# directory. Note that each static site needs to have a 404.php
# file to allow for correct 404 handling. Sites with multiple domain
# names should either have code added to redirect the user to the
# correct domain
#
# RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^alternate.domain$ [NC]
# RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ http://official.domain/$1 [L,R]
# Or, if the alternate domain is desired, set up the alternate domain
# sites folder but symlink sites/alternate.domain/files/html to
# sites/official.domain/files/html
#
# For www.domain variants, just capture the non www portion of the
# domain below.
#
# Each domain match added should contain [NC,OR] except the very
# last RewriteCond line before the RewriteRule.
#

# Catch our subdirectory cases where infinite symlink recursion can yield odd (but legit) URLs
# that make the GSA spider lose its mind
#RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/dir((/dir)+)(.*)$
#RewriteRule ^.*$ /dir%3 [R=301,L]
